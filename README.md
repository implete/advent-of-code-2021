## Day 1: Sonar Sweep

1. Count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.
2. Ccunt the number of times the sum of measurements in the three-measurement window increases from the previous sum.

# Day 2: Dive!

1. Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?
  - forward X increases the horizontal position by X units.
  - down X increases the depth by X units.
  - up X decreases the depth by X units.

2. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?
  - down X increases your aim by X units.
  - up X decreases your aim by X units.
  - forward X does two things:
    - It increases your horizontal position by X units.
    - It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.
